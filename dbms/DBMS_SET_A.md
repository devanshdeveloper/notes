# Database Management System - Set A

Q1. What do you mean by Database Architecture? Define all levels of abstraction.

1. **Introduction**
   - Database architecture refers to the structured way of organizing and managing data in a database system
   - It follows a three-level abstraction hierarchy to separate the physical storage from user interaction

2. **Main Content**
   - Three Levels of Data Abstraction:
     
     a) **External Level (View Level)**
     - Highest level of abstraction
     - Deals with user interaction with the database
     - Different users see different views of the same data
     - Hides complexity of physical data storage
     
     b) **Conceptual Level (Logical Level)**
     - Middle level of abstraction
     - Describes what data is stored and relationships
     - Includes all entities, attributes, and relationships
     - Independent of both physical storage and user views
     
     c) **Internal Level (Physical Level)**
     - Lowest level of abstraction
     - Describes how data is actually stored
     - Deals with physical storage structures
     - Includes file organization and indexing

3. **Conclusion**
   - Database architecture's three-level abstraction ensures:
     - Data independence
     - Data security
     - Reduced complexity
     - Efficient data management

Q14. How will you create a table and insert values? Write a command with suitable examples.

1. **Introduction**
   - Table creation and data insertion are fundamental database operations
   - SQL provides specific commands for these operations

2. **Main Content**

   a) **Creating Tables (CREATE TABLE)**
   - Defines table structure and constraints

       CONSTRAINT chk_email CHECK (Email LIKE '%@%.%')
   );
   ```

   b) **Inserting Data (INSERT INTO)**
   - Single row insertion:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Students
   VALUES (1, 'John', 'Doe', 'john.doe@email.com', '2000-05-15', 'Computer Science');
   ```

   - Multiple row insertion:
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO Students
   VALUES 
       (2, 'Jane', 'Smith', 'jane.smith@email.com', '2001-03-20', 'Physics'),
       (3, 'Mike', 'Johnson', 'mike.j@email.com', '2000-11-10', 'Mathematics');
   ```

Q15. What is Boyce Codd Normal Form? How is it stronger than 3NF?

1. **Introduction**
   - BCNF is an advanced form of database normalization
   - Represents a stronger version of Third Normal Form (3NF)

2. **Main Content**

   a) **BCNF Definition**
   - A relation is in BCNF if for every dependency A → B:
     - A is a superkey, or
     - B is part of a candidate key
   
   b) **Comparison with 3NF**
   - 3NF allows non-prime attributes to be functionally dependent on candidate keys
   - BCNF eliminates all functional dependencies except those on superkeys

   c) **Example:**
   ```
   Consider relation: Course(StudentID, Subject, Professor)
   Dependencies:
   Professor → Subject
   StudentID, Subject → Professor

   In 3NF but not in BCNF because:
   Professor → Subject (Professor is not a superkey)

   BCNF Decomposition:
   Professor_Subject(Professor, Subject)
   Student_Professor(StudentID, Professor)
   ```

   d) **Advantages of BCNF**
   - Eliminates all anomalies
   - Ensures stronger data integrity
   - Reduces redundancy further than 3NF

3. **Conclusion**
   - BCNF provides stricter normalization than 3NF
   - Sometimes sacrifices dependency preservation
   - Ideal for eliminating data anomalies
